# Movie-Rating-Analysis
With this project we will get the analysis of profitable, non profitable movies along with popularity of actors and analysis of movies according to their genre.

We have the data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this project, we will try to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.
